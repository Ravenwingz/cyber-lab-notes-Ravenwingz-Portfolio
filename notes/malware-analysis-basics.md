# 🐛 Malware Analysis Basics

This document introduces basic concepts and tools used in malware analysis, covering both static and dynamic techniques.

---

## 🧪 Lab Environment Setup

- **OS**: Windows 10 (isolated VM)
- **Tools**: 
  - FlareVM / REMnux
  - PEStudio
  - Wireshark
  - Procmon, Process Hacker
  - INetSim or FakeNet-NG

---

## 🔍 Static Analysis

- **Hashing** (MD5, SHA256)
- **Strings extraction**
- **PE Header inspection** using PEStudio
- **Suspicious section flags**
- **Known packers or obfuscation**

---

## 🚀 Dynamic Analysis

- Run malware in a **sandboxed VM**
- Observe:
  - Network traffic
  - File writes/reads
  - Registry changes
  - Process creation

---

## 🎯 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

- Domains or IP addresses
- File hashes
- Registry keys
- File paths

---

## 🧠 Reflections

- Malware analysis requires caution and a controlled environment
- This area is crucial for detecting, responding to, and preventing threats
- Learning to extract IOCs improves both red and blue team efficiency
